# STP-Project
I created a project on Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to demonstrate how it prevents network loops and protects against broadcast storms. The setup involved connecting two PCs with three routers. When STP was enabled, it intelligently shut down one port to prevent redundant paths and loops. However, when STP was disabled, all ports remained active, causing multiple routes to open between the PCs, leading to a broadcast storm where packets failed to reach their destination. I used the ping command in simulation mode to observe and verify this behavior. To check the STP status, I used the command `(config# show spanning-tree)`. To enable STP, I applied the command `(config# spanning-tree vlan 0001)`, and to disable it, I used `(config# no spanning-tree vlan 0001)`. This further highlighted the importance of STP in maintaining a stable and loop-free network.
